**Objective:**

The objective of this project is to analyze an American electric vehicle dataset using Power BI, focusing on understanding the landscape, trends, and market dynamics of electric vehicles (EVs). By examining key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations, we aim to derive insights into the total number of EVs, their average electric range, the proportion of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), as well as their distribution across different states, manufacturers, and models.

**Tools Used:**

Power BI is utilized as the primary tool for data analysis and visualization due to its robust capabilities in handling large datasets, creating interactive visuals, and deriving actionable insights. Additionally, Microsoft Excel may be used for data preprocessing and cleaning before importing into Power BI.

**Problem Statement:**

1.The dataset contains information on American electric vehicles and requires comprehensive analysis to address the following key challenges:

2.Understanding the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.

3.Determining the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.

4.Identifying and analyzing the total number of BEVs and PHEVs in the dataset, along with their respective percentages relative to the total number of electric vehicles, to gain insights into the dominance of fully electric models versus plug-in hybrid models.

5.Creating visualizations to showcase the distribution of electric vehicles over the years, across different states, top manufacturers, and popular models, providing insights into adoption trends, geographical preferences, and consumer behavior.

**Key Skills Learning:**

This project offers an opportunity to enhance various skills, including:

Proficiency in data preprocessing and cleaning techniques to ensure data accuracy. Mastery in data visualization using Power BI, including the creation of interactive dashboards, charts, and maps. Analytical skills to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets.
